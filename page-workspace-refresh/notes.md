## Notes
- Initialized workspace for improving Local Notion browser UI to make page creation and browsing clearer.
- Updated App layout plan: capture selected page state centrally so the UI can mimic a workspace with sidebar controls and main viewer.
- Wired PageCreator with an `onCreated` callback so the surrounding workspace can auto-open newly created pages.
- Reworked PageExplorer to sync with the selected page from App, added clearer instructions, and introduced an empty state message.
- PageDirectory now loads immediately on mount and refreshes whenever a new page is created.
- Styled both creator panels as cards with guidance so the sidebar reads like a control area.
- Refreshed App.css with workspace, sidebar, and stack helpers so the new layout reads clearly on desktop and mobile.
- Documented the refreshed workspace flow in README so users know where to create and browse pages.
- Stabilized PageDirectory loading with useCallback-based fetch helpers.
- Converted page loading helpers to useCallback to avoid duplicate fetches when props change.
- Verified build (`npm run build`) and backend tests (`go test ./...`) to ensure the refreshed UI works end-to-end.
